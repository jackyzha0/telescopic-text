# ðŸ”­ Telescopic Text

An open-source library to help with creating expandable text. 

Inspired by [StretchText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StretchText) and [TelescopicText](https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC).

I've been thinking a lot about creating a browsable store of knowledge that provides something useful at all distance scales
(e.g. viewing the entire library, just a subcategory, a single file, etc.) and concepts like Telescopic Text are a first step
in creating more information scales than just a single document level.
